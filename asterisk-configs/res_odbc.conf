# asterisk-configs/res_odbc.conf

# The res_odbc.conf file is an Asterisk configuration file used to define ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) settings for database integration.
# It specifies the connection details for the ODBC data source, including the DSN (Data Source Name), username, password, 
# and other parameters like maximum connections and pre-connection behavior. 
# This configuration allows Asterisk to interact with databases via ODBC for tasks such as querying or storing call data.
